# SNICSer
Data reduction and database interface for NOSAMS AMS data.

## Introduction
SNICSr is a package written in Visual Basic. Visual Studio is probably the best tool for working with the code.
The software was written for use with Fudger style AMS data and is tightly integrated with the NOSAMS database. Methods for normalization and fractionation correction are based on those used by Fudger. Blank correction is a combination of a bulk correction and a mass balance correction for small samples.
